# JB-DEALERS Car Dealership Website::-
Designed a car dealership website using C#, .NET and MVC. This is fully user-friendly, Admin needs no technical knowledge to maintain this website.
Applied User Authentication methodology for the login of Admin and Session for security. Has separate controllers for Users and Admins.
Used inheritance with the base class and derived class for easy reference to methods. Used layered architecture along with Repository, Data Access for the flow of commands and accessing information from the database.
Bridge pattern is used with interface and class combination for loose coupling of layers.
Used SQL server as database. It is loosely coupled with the web application, so can change the database to any other with few modifications in the code.
